multiple tcc states can be used to create separate namespaces


can add object files- could bulid each file in project, then add them each in turn?
this seems the same as compiling them in from source, but perhaps slightly faster?

can have separate tcc states for each wrk.c file, each declaring a wrk_main function
then have one tcc state for the program, which each wrk_main function receives and
adds files to


read wrk.c file- if it starts with #!, each up to tcc, then to -run, and pass remaining
argments to libtcc. this allows linking wrk.c files against libraries such as pthreads
generally better to add functions to wrk, or use single header files ones, but allows
normal libraries as well.


likely have to link work into each wrk.c file- either as an so, ar, or just compile in the
code
